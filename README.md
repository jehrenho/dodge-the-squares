# Dodge the Squares Game

A browser-based game built with **TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS**.  
Players dodge hazards and adapt to dynamic modifiers while difficulty ramps up over time!

This project demonstrates:  
- **Proficiency in TypeScript/JavaScript**  
- **Object-oriented design and modular architecture**  
- **Game loop and state management**  
- **Problem-solving with scalable systems** (collision-action matrix)

## ⚡ Features

- **Interactive tutorial:** “How to Play” screen introduces controls and objectives  
- **Responsive controls:** Move with arrow keys within game boundaries  
- **Dynamic hazards:** Randomly generated obstacles that damage player health  
- **Modifiers system:**  
  - **Enlarge Hazard:** temporary hazard size increase  
  - **Shrink Hazard:** temporary hazard size decrease  
  - **Ice Rink:** reduced acceleration  
  - **Invincibility:** temporary immunity  
  - **Extra Life:** grants bonus health  
- **Visual feedback:** Flash effects for collisions and modifier expiration  
- **Difficulty scaling:** Logarithmic increase in challenge over time  
- **Pause/resume:** Spacebar toggles pause  
- **Adaptive canvas:** Automatically resizes to fit the browser window

## 📁 File Structure

- `game.ts` — main game loop & game state  
- `artist.ts` — rendering logic  
- `menu.ts` — menu generation  
- `player.ts` — player state & movement  
- `hazardManager.ts` — hazard creation & management  
- `modifierManager.ts` — modifier creation & management  
- `modifierEffect.ts` — modifier effect logic  
- `collisionFlasher.ts` — collision animations  
- `collisionUtils.ts` — collision logic  
- `input.ts` — input handling  
- `config.ts` — configuration constants & collision matrix  
- `visibleShape.ts` — abstract base class for all game objects

## 🧩 Challenges

### Collision-Action Matrix
Managing interactions between multiple simultaneous modifiers was a major design challenge.  
For example, colliding with an **Ice Rink** effect should:  
- Activate if no effect is active  
- Reset if Ice Rink is already active  
- Be ignored if Invincibility is active  

Hard-coding all cases would be unscalable.  

**Solution:** Implemented a strongly-typed collision–action matrix in `config.ts`, structured as:

```ts
collisionMatrix[role: CollisionRole][oldType: ModifierType][newType: ModifierType]
```

This approach ensures clarity, scalability, and type safety when adding new effects

### Collision Detection
Every frame, the game checks whether the **player square** collides with either: 
- 🟥 **Hazards (squares)** 
- 🟢 **Modifiers (circles)** 

**Solution:** To handle this efficiently, two classic algorithms are used: 

- **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)** → for player–hazard collisions 
- **Circle–AABB** → for player–modifier collisions 

This ensures fast, reliable collision checks even as the number of hazards and modifiers increases.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Improve window resizing (prevent stretching). 
- New modifiers: 
  - Blind — temporary screen obstruction 
  - Rain — randomize hazard speed with gradual damping 
  - Wave — sinusoidal hazard movement with gradual damping 
  - Shield — temporary hazard resistance 
- Adjust modifier spawn frequency based on survival time. 
- Leaderboard backend with score submission and display.
